**Agentic PM Skills** is a marketplace of PM skills and chained workflows across 9 plugins. Designed natively for Claude Code and Cowork (and compatible with other AI assistants), it transforms your LLM from a generic text generator into a structured, rigorous Product Management engine.

From continuous discovery to go-to-market strategy, execution, and vibe coding—get the rigor of industry leaders (like Teresa Torres and Marty Cagan) built directly into your daily automated workflow.

> [!NOTE]
> This repository is a heavily extended and actively maintained fork of [phuryn/pm-skills](https://github.com/phuryn/pm-skills), originally created by **Paweł Huryn**. See [What's New in This Fork](#-whats-new-in-this-fork) for details.

<br />

## 🚀 The "Aha" Moment: Why Use This?

Generic AI gives you walls of text. **This repository gives you structure.**

Each skill encodes a specific, proven analytical framework. When you trigger a command, the AI doesn't just guess; it walks you through a step-by-step process for assumption mapping, prioritization, and strategy definition.

> **The result:** Better, faster product decisions — not just faster documents.

<br />

```

| Concept | What it is | Example |
|:--------|:-----------|:--------|
| **🧠 Skill** | Domain knowledge, analytical framework, or guided workflow for a specific PM task. Loaded automatically when relevant. | `opportunity-solution-tree`, `prioritization` |
| **⚡ Command** | User-triggered workflow (`/command-name`) that chains one or more skills into an end-to-end process. | `/discover` chains: ideation → assumptions → prioritization → experiments |
| **📦 Plugin** | Installable package grouping related skills and commands by PM domain. | `pm-product-discovery`, `pm-execution` |

Skills are loaded automatically when relevant to the conversation — no explicit invocation needed. If needed (e.g., prioritizing skills over general knowledge), you can **force loading skills** with `/plugin-name:skill-name` or `/skill-name`.

Installing the marketplace gives you all 9 plugins at once. Commands are designed to flow into each other, matching the PM workflow — after any command completes, it suggests relevant next commands.

<br />

## 🛠️ How Vibe Coding Skills Work

Vibe coding is the practice of building software through natural language instructions to AI coding assistants, with the human providing product direction, design judgment, and validation rather than writing code line-by-line. The `pm-vibe-coding` plugin is designed specifically to help PMs do this effectively.

### Starting Out
Use `/plan-prototype` or ask _"Help me plan a prototype build"_. The skill helps you scope the MVP to the minimum features needed, identify the single most important user story, and define what "done" looks like — before writing a single line of code.

### Choosing and Installing the Right Tools
The `prototype-plan` skill includes a built-in tool selection guide based on your project's needs:

| What you're building | Recommended tool |
|----------------------|-----------------|
| Frontend UI only (no backend needed) | Bolt.new or v0.dev |
| Quick full-stack demo, zero setup | Replit Agent |
| Complex full-stack app with fine-grained control | Cursor |
| Existing VS Code project or iterative work | GitHub Copilot |
| Complex logic, debugging, architecture | Claude Code |
| Multi-file agentic flows | Windsurf |

Once you pick a tool, `/vibe-spec` generates the natural-language spec document that you paste directly into your chosen AI coding assistant — giving it all the context it needs to build correctly the first time.

### Starting to Code
The build sequence recommended by `prototype-plan` guides you through:
1. **Foundation**: Set up the project, define data model, connect database
2. **Backend/API**: Build core endpoints, add validation, test with a client
3. **Frontend**: Build the primary user flow, connect to backend
4. **Auth**: Add sign-up/login, protect routes
5. **Deploy**: Deploy to hosting, set environment variables, run final checklist

At each stage, checkpoints verify you're ready to move on. The `code-review-for-pms` skill helps you review AI-generated code from a product and security lens, and `debug-with-ai` guides you when things break. Before shipping, `/deploy-check` runs through a pre-launch checklist covering security, performance, and accessibility.

## 📥 Installation

### ⚡ MCP Server — works everywhere, zero clone needed

`ai-pm-skills-mcp` is an [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server that exposes all 89 skills and 59 commands as tools to **any MCP-compatible client** — Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, and more — without cloning this repo.

**One-time setup per client:**

<details>
<summary><strong>Claude Desktop</strong> (<code>~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json</code>)</summary>

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "pm-skills": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "ai-pm-skills-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Claude Code</strong> (run once in your terminal)</summary>

```bash
claude mcp add pm-skills -- npx -y ai-pm-skills-mcp
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Cursor</strong> (<code>~/.cursor/mcp.json</code>)</summary>

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "pm-skills": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "ai-pm-skills-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Windsurf</strong> (Settings → MCP Servers → Add)</summary>

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "pm-skills": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "ai-pm-skills-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```
</details>

Once configured, ask your AI assistant:
- *"List all PM skills"* → calls `list_plugins` / `list_skills`
- *"Get the lean-canvas skill"* → calls `get_skill`
- *"Search for OKR skills"* → calls `search_skills`

> **No git clone, no copy-paste, no manual updates.** `npx` always pulls the latest published version.

## ⚠️ Known Issue on Windows

If your Cowork is unstable and can't start a VM ([claude-code/issues/27010](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/27010)), try:

```powershell
$action = New-ScheduledTaskAction -Execute "powershell.exe" -Argument "-WindowStyle Hidden -Command `"if ((Get-Service CoworkVMService).Status -ne 'Running') { Start-Service CoworkVMService }`""

$trigger = New-ScheduledTaskTrigger -RepetitionInterval (New-TimeSpan -Minutes 1) -Once -At (Get-Date)

$settings = New-ScheduledTaskSettingsSet -AllowStartIfOnBatteries -DontStopIfGoingOnBatteries

Register-ScheduledTask -TaskName "CoworkVMServiceMonitor" `
  -Action $action `
  -Trigger $trigger `
  -Settings $settings `
  -RunLevel Highest `
  -User "SYSTEM"
```

It solves 90% of the issues on Windows.
The remaining 10%: open services.msc > start "Claude" service manually
